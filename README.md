# Minifigs Collection

**How many minifigures from your childhood will you find?**

The purpose of this simple project was practicing working with Angular and API. It uses Dexie for storing minifigures.

*You revealed your API key!*  
-> I created account only to be able to get data from Rebrickable.com, I don't use this account. Additionally according to Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller:
*Things like API keys can generally go in there though since people are not able to access any of your accounts with them.* [Hide JavaScript Code](https://academind.com/tutorials/hide-javascript-code)  
And well, I wanted also to make this app available for my nephews :)
