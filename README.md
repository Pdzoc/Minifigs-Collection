# Minifigs Collection

**How many minifigures from your childhood will you find?**

You can just browse minifigures database or search minifig by themes or keyword. Policeman, Driver, Crazy Scientist... This application will be very useful if you want to teach English to your children or siblings. Just let them explore - they will memorize vocabulary much faster in the context of their favourite toy.

The purpose of this simple project was to practice working with Angular and API. It uses Dexie for storing minifigures.
